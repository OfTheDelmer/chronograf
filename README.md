## Installation

Check out the [INSTALLATION](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md) guide to get up and running with Chronograf with as little configuration and code as possible.

We recommend installing Chronograf using one of the [pre-built packages](https://influxdata.com/downloads/#chronograf). Then start Chronograf using:

* `service chronograf start` if you have installed Chronograf using an official Debian or RPM package.
* `systemctl start chronograf` if you have installed Chronograf using an official Debian or RPM package, and are running a distro with `systemd`. For example, Ubuntu 15 or later.
* `$GOPATH/bin/chronograf` if you have built Chronograf from source.

### With Docker
To get started right away with Docker, you can pull down our latest alpha:

```sh
docker pull quay.io/influxdb/chronograf:latest
```

### From Source

* Chronograf works with go 1.7.3, npm 3.10.7 and node v6.6.0. Additional version support of these projects will be implemented soon, but these are the only supported versions to date.
* Chronograf requires [Kapacitor](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor) 1.1 to create and store alerts.
